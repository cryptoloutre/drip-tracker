But watch your back, ‘cause if the NPCS (New Pulse City Security) catches you doodling on this urban canvas, they don’t hand out gold stars. Maybe it’s the crumbs of mana they’re missing out on, or perhaps they’re just addicted to the adrenaline rush of cracking down on these rebellious bots. Either way, it’s a city where the underground dealings paint the shadows, and the NPCS dance a ballet of aggression that’s more intense than a bot in a rocket launcher showdown. Welcome to the concrete jungle, where rules are meant to be broken, but watch out for the enforcers who seem to have a penchant for breaking bots."',

These ain’t just vehicles; they’re canvases waiting to be kissed by the spray paint gods. No rules, no security, just the sweet freedom to turn rust into art. It’s the best chill spot in town, where your imagination can run wild on the metal. The only rule is there are no rules. So, grab your cans, find a rusty beauty, and let the outskirts be your canvas – the artist’s sanctuary in the concrete jungle."',
