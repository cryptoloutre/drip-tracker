      "While there's a deep sense of celestial wonder and mystique, there's also a comforting feel of an old village where everyone knows your name. The juxtaposition of the familiar with the fantastic makes Saturnia Greenfire a unique cosmic haven, embodying both the vastness of the universe and the coziness of home.\n" +

    description: "Siiri means a beautiful woman who is victorious according to some name site online. Drawn by artist Anneli while remembering Siiri. For me this name is personal, it was my grandmother's name. The dragon Kalevi released earlier as a PFP is her son, my uncle. I name some characters after amazing people I grew up with. Siiri for me means a super creative, clever and fierce woman, who claimed to be ugly. She understood me best. As a young woman visiting her she would ask if I had money, and I always answered yes and then I found an envelope in the pocket of my jacket with some money in it because she knew I'd lie. May the holder of Siiri be protected in situations you hide from others (but not illegal shit, she wasn't that kind of woman aight? AIGHT!)",
