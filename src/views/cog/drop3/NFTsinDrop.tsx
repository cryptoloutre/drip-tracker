    description: "Saturnia Greenfire nestles in the embrace of vast cosmic landscapes, where Saturn's rings cast a radiant shimmer over cobblestone streets. The city feels timeless, as if lifted straight out of a storybook, yet is colored with the hues of the cosmos. While there's a deep sense of celestial wonder and mystique, there's also a comforting feel of an old village where everyone knows your name. The juxtaposition of the familiar with the fantastic makes Saturnia Greenfire a unique cosmic haven, embodying both the vastness of the universe and the coziness of home. By Swedish artist Anneli Olander Berglund 2023. Digital artwork / Illustrator / Warm thanks to everyone who participated while live drawing.",
