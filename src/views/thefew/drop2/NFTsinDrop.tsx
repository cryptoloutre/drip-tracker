    description: 'The city of Avidora, nestled between rolling hills, once stood in tranquil splendor with bustling streets and towering skyscrapers curving around the Earth. However, one fateful morning, seismic tremors shattered the peace. Initial rumbles, subtle like distant thunder, escalated into a quake that sent panic coursing through the city. Buildings swayed, roads cracked, and the Earth itself seemed to protest with a mighty roar.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'From the chaos emerged a colossal force, splitting Avidora in two. The flourishing metropolis became ensnared by an unforeseen mountain range, leaving its people to grapple with a fractured home. The shattered remains became a haven for desperate souls, fueled by loss and resentment, scavenging in the shadows and preying on those venturing into the rubble.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Nightfall brought an eerie atmosphere to Avidora. The moon cast a glow on the jagged peaks, revealing strange glimmers dancing along the rocks. Whispers circulated among survivors—tales of treasures and mystical powers hidden within the mountain range. But no one dared to venture into the eerie night full of raiders and treacherous slopes. No one except a brave soul named Raka.\n',
