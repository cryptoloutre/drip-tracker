    description: "Beyond Orion and after chimeras, She waits for me... she doesn't care if I die... She dies of grief and no one knows. Fortunately or unfortunately I always come back to dinner, With carbon embedded in my fingertips crying supreme words! Chosen by God, the middle finger against the system, Each one carries his cross Mine writes poems.  You don't need to pretend it if you really don't reach him... I take prisms with patience, I make spheres with the same cream... Everything is heart and loyalty to the emblem... Even if it hurts, I give everything away As if it fills me, As if it's spring and we water the ground with champagne and coins... Take it on the fly... or take it from the ground without anyone seeing you...",
