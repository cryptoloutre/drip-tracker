    description: `Today stands as a historic day, marking the moment when Degen PFPs made a transformative leap from the realm of degeneracy into the IRL real world. As the Degens ascend mentally and spiritually up Maslow's hierarchy, the astral energy intensifies and compounds. One morning, King Robert discovered himself perched on (rather than in) his Saga mobile phone. "What sorcery is this?" he pondered. And when he opened his mouth, the utterance that emerged was not the familiar "ribbit" but rather the unexpected proclamation of "coin". Here’s wishing you lots of prosperity in degen coin season. To be continued.`,
